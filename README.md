This repository contains a bunch of images and files I use for various things
including dev environments, testing, cloud containers, etc . . .

## How-to-use

It's actually really simple to build.  It's designed to work with [rustery](git@github.com:Lonestar137/rustery.git)

To build the containers simply run this command from the root of the repo:
```bash
rustery
# OR, to see what it WOULD do if it were to run:
rustery --dryrun
```
